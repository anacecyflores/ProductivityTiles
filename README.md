# ProductivityTiles

The Eisenhower Matrix is an organization system that allows you to organize your tasks from “MUST do now” to “Delete”, not needed to finish today.
Our app, with the help of the theory behind the Eisenhower Matrix, will help you to…
· Rank your most important and urgent tasks above the rest
· Eliminate time-wasting tasks, by helping you identify the non-essential ones
· With our simple but easy-to-use interface, you can create your tasks
· And then position them as you want
· With everything laid out in front of you, you can create more mental space to make progress on your goals
Productivity Tiles helps you become your best you!
